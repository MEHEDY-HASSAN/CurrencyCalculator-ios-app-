# CurrencyCalculator-ios-app-

This app includes a dedicated login and registration section. While it may seem unconventional for a currency calculator app, it was a mandatory requirement in our lab to incorporate a database into our projects. We decided to use this opportunity to enhance our learning experience and gain a deeper understanding of user authentication and account management within iOS app development.

The main purpose of implementing this section was to challenge ourselves and expand our knowledge in the realm of user authentication.
